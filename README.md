# @decentstack/hyperplexer

> hypercore multiplexer and replication manager

`Version: pre-release`

hyperplexer is a replication-manager designed to effectively replicate
multiple feeds on single peer connections.

In order to ovecome the O(n^n) issues that arise in swarms with high feed counts:

- [x] feed-filters
- [ ] feed hot-swapping (in progress) _epic_
- [ ] compress peer#feeds LUTs
- [ ] cache exchange-headers

Other features:
- [x] Acts as hypercore-protocol-extension host
- [ ] Make ext-host impl uniform using [abstract-extension](https://github.com/mafintosh/abstract-extension/)

If you're reading this it means that the docs are missing or in a bad state.

Writing and maintaining friendly and useful documentation takes
effort and time. In order to do faster releases
I will from now on provide documentation relational to project activity.
